   4-7           General Error Enumeration 0-15.                                                            
                 Reserved for use of specific protocols for error reporting.  Interpretation of these bits  
   0-3           will be defined in the specific protocol documentation.  A value of zero in this field     
                 means no further information is available.

   Permanent Error Enumeration. Re-trying the same interaction will result in the same error.
   0x1000        Permanent error, not further specified.                                                    
   0x1010        Unimplemented, not further specified.                                                      
   0x1020        Source not permitted.

   0x1050        Unimplemented, subcommand is unknown.                                                      
   0x1060        Unimplemented, Datagram-type, Stream-type, or command is unknown.                          
   0x1070        Unimplemented, unknown MTI, or Transport protocol (datagrams/streams) is not supported.    
   0x1080        Invalid arguments. Some of the values sent in the message fall outside of the expected     
                 range, or do not match the expectations of the receiving node.

   Temporary Error (resent OK).  Re-trying the same interaction later is likely to succeed.
   0x2000        Temporary error, not further not specified.

                 Unexpected, Out of order. An inconsistency was found in the message or frame sequence      
   0x2040        received, the arrived message is unexpected or does not match the state of the receiving   
                 node.

   0x2080        Transfer error.  The message or received message was ill-formed, failed checksum, or is    
                 otherwise uninterpretable.  On CAN, this is handled by the hardware.                       
   0x2090-0x20F0 Reserved.                                                                                  
   Reserved      
   0x4000        Reserved.  Write as zero, ignored on read.                                                 
   Accept Flag   
   0x8000        Accept, no error.  This value shall not be used in reject messages.                        

    

    

   Examples:  

    

   Protocol X might define:

   0x0001 – error flag 1

   0x0002 – error flag 2

   0x0004 – error flag 3

   0x0008 – error flag 4

   So, a node might send:

       0x1051 unimplemented subcommand, flag 1

   or 0x1053 unimplemented subcommand, flag 1 and flag 2

    

    

   Protocol Y might define:

   0x0001 – enumeration 1

   0x0002 – enumeration 2

   0x0003 – enumeration  3

   0x0004 – enumeration  4

   So, a node might send:

       0x1051 unimplemented subcommand, reason1

   or 0x1054 unimplemented subcommand, reason4
