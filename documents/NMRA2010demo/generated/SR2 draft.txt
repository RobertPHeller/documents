    

   S9.6 has thought about the hard problems and come up with an integrated solution for novices to experts
   and small to large layouts.  

    

    1. Simplicity for the first time user: A novice can buy two nodes, hook them together and start to
       teach them to interact.  

    2. Support for the large modular layout: S9.6 prevents conflict between modules and automates set-up.
        Meets do not need to pre-assign or keep lists of number.  

    3. Automatic traffic control and filtering: S9.6 has this built into the protocol and can use fast
       buses to interconnect multiple bus segments.  

    4. Cost effective: S9.6 efficiently bridges to legacy equipment maintaining your prior investments.  

    

   When things are new or small:

    

   S9.6 simplifies life for teh novice.  Nodes come with factory loaded numbers.  The novice can simply
   plug nodes together, program them, and control his accessories.  Nodes can be programmed with as few as
   two push-buttons using what we call the Blue-Gold method.  

    

   When things are big:

    

    

   S9.6 has ample room for growth. And can easily handle large layouts including large modular layouts.
      Since all nodes have guaranteed different numbers, nodes can not conflict even when multiple groups
   get together with their pre-programmed modules - none of the modules need to be re-programmed except to
   teach new interactions.  No pre-allocation or lists are necessary.  S9.6 also automates the set-up and
   configuration of the modules.  

    

    

   When things are too full or too busy:

   S9.6 can start as one segment consisting of two nodes or multiple segments connected by a fast S9.6 bus.
    If a segment gets too many nodes, or too much traffic, it can be split into two segments.  Multiple
   segments can be oined by repeater-nodes or bridge-nodes that can automatically filter and route traffic
   to just those segments that need it.  

    

    

   Save some money:

    

   S9.6 let's you keep using your legacy equipment by bridging to it and integrating it into the LCB.  For
   example, you can feed DCC accessory commands onto the LCB.   

    

    

   When things are complex:

    

   S9.6 lets you connect one or computers to the LCB to let you configure, debug, or operate your layout.
