                                      OpenLCB / NMRAnet Development Kit

   The kit was funded, designed, assembled and distributed to 20 model railroaders around the world,
   including New Zealand, Australia, Canada, USA, Spain, Holland, the UK and Denmark.  

Use highlights:

     * Don Goodman-Wilson, Ken Cameron, David Harris and others demonstrated the DevKit, and use of its
        nodes for layout control and traction.  

     * Ken Cameron demonstrated the DevKit at the Springfield Show this January.  

     * The UK:  ... to use the dev kit components in an extension I’m currently building to the railway and
       ... using them for a combination of the following ...report block occupancy,  control point motors,
       control led signals, report control panel switch changes, ...integrate support into my current
       software to allow a seamless mix and match of components.

     *  ... the philosophy of my little business is to offer to spanish market high quality products no one
       more offers in Spain, I'm sure there is a big job to do introducing openlcb in Spain.

     * ... creating touch user interfaces for control of model railroads. The device I built, that I
       briefly described in my application to the OPENLCB Yahoo group, had a small (3.4") color LCD with
       touch as the means of controlling turnouts with servos... that a network  connection to the servos
       (and what ever else needed, or wanted to be controlled)  would reduce the rats nest of wires that a
       large layout would require.
