                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This specification describes the format and allocation of OpenLCB node identifiers (node IDs). It is not
   specific to any wire protocol.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Many OpenLCB protocols rely on each node having a node ID, and those node IDs being absolutely unique
   between nodes. This Standard is intended to ensure these node IDs are available, and hence applies to
   all OpenLCB nodes.

                                                   4 Format

   An OpenLCB node identifier (node ID) shall be six bytes of eight bits each.

   The order of bytes in an OpenLCB node ID shall be considered significant. The most-significant byte
   shall be transmitted first during communication operations. The most-significant byte shall be written
   first (left-most in Western format) in any human-readable representation.

   OpenLCB node IDs shall include one or more 1 bits.

                                                 5 Allocation

   Every OpenLCB node shall have a unique node identifier.

   Node identifiers shall be allocated using one of the mechanisms in this section.
