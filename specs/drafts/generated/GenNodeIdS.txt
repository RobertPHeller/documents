   An OpenLCB node identifier (node ID) shall be six bytes of eight bits each.

   The order of bytes in an OpenLCB node ID shall be considered significant. The most-significant byte
   shall be transmitted first during communication operations. The most-significant byte shall be written
   first (left-most in Western format) in any human-readable representation.

   OpenLCB node IDs shall include one or more 1 bits.

                                                 5 Allocation

   Every OpenLCB node shall have a unique node identifier.

   Node identifiers shall be allocated using one of the mechanisms in this section.
