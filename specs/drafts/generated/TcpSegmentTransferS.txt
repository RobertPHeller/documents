                                          4 Message Form (Normative)

   Individual messages are preceded by a preamble that contains:

     * Flags - 16 bit quantity, the most-significant bits are reserved. The least significant bit indicates
       whether the remaining message is a common OpenLCB message or some other message. The 2nd bit is a
       chaining bit, indicating that another header is contained within this one.

     * Originating gateway Node ID – the Node ID of the gateway that send/forwarded this message onto the
       point-to-point or multicast link. May or may not be the original source of the message.

     * Message capture time at originating gateway - a 32-bit (64-bit?) number of monotonic milliseconds
       (microseconds?) since (before) the connection was created; no time synchronization with other nodes
       implied; could have been a sequence number

     * Number of bytes in rest of message, a 16-bit quantity.
