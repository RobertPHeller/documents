                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This OpenLCB Standard describes the protocol for transporting OpenLCB events across the OpenLCB network.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Transporting events provides general and flexible messaging between nodes, following the principles of
   the Producer-Consumer model.  The information is carried by an Event Identifier (Event ID ), a number
   which in of itself does not have any explicit information.  Instead the Event ID is assigned by the user
   to one specific concept, such as a specific lighting configuration, or a more abstract concept, such as
   the “start of the day” or “global stop”.   That concept can then be implemented by cooperative action
   between nodes that “produce” the event by sending messages, and nodes that “consume” the event by
   receiving messages and acting up them.  This document defines that interaction between produces and
   consumers in terms of OpenLCB messages.

   This document describes the required message formats for event transport. §4 gives an overview of the
   message types with an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide to the construction of
   concrete message types over specific physical transport media. §§7–ff. describe in concrete detail the
   implementation of the event transport message formats for the specific physical transport media that
   have been adopted as normative standards.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB-CAN Standards:

     * The OpenLCB Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact.
       Higher-level protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere. The Message
       Network Standard defines the Initialized node state which is referenced here.

     * The OpenLCB Event Identifiers Standard, which defines the format and content of  Event IDs including
       the class of Well-Known Event IDs and Automatically-Routed Event IDs.

     * The OpenLCB-CAN Frame Transport Standard, which defines the formats for transporting OpenLCB over
       CAN networks.

                                        4 Message Formats (Normative)

   In the following, the “Common MTI” column specifies the the MTI value to be used when communicating in
   OpenLCB common format. The Common MTI is an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide
   to the construction of concrete message formats over specific physical transport media.

   “EventID Range” in the Data Content field refers to a range of EventID values specified through a
   compare-under-mask operation.  The low bit of the field defines the sign of the mask: a 1
   least-significant bit indicates the mask is represented by 1 bits, and similarly for a 0 LSB. The mask
   is made up of the adjacent identical bits: if the lowest bit is a '0', then all low order contiguous '0'
   bits will form a mask, while if the lowest bit is a '1', then the low order contiguous '1' bits will
   form the mask.  The remaining upper bits determine the range prefix. To determine whether an Event ID
   “E” lies within the range “R”, compute:

   inRange = ( (E & ~ mask) == (R & ~ mask) )

       it had just consumed this event

     * Currently invalid – the internal state of the consumer & associated devices is known to not be the
       same as if it had just consumed this event

     * Currently unknown – the consumer cannot determine whether either of the previous conditions is true

   This message has three sub-forms, which carry the status of the identified producer.  They are,
   respectively:

     * Currently valid – the internal state of the producer & associated devices is known to that which
       would cause them to produce the event

     * Currently invalid – the internal state of the producer & associated devices is known to not be the
       same as that which would cause them to produce the event

     * Currently unknown – the producer cannot determine whether either of the previous conditions is true

                                             5 States (Normative)

   Each consumer and producer of each event has two possible states:  “Unadvertised” and “Advertised”.

   When the node hosting the producer or consumer is not in Initialized state, the consumer or producer
   shall be in and remain in Unadvertised state.

   A producer or consumer of a specific event moves to Advertised state when any of the following happens:

     * The producer or consumer sends a Producer Identified or Consumer Identified, respectively, message
       containing the Event ID.

     * The producer or consumer sends a Producer Range Identified or Consumer Range Identified,
       respectively, message where the indicated range contains the Event ID.

     * Producers and consumers of Event IDs in the automatically-advertised range are in the Advertised
       state once the node is in the Initialized state.

   The messages defined by this Standard shall only be sent when the sending node is in Initialized state.

   Producer/Consumer Event Report messages may only be sent when the associated producer is in Advertised
   state.  OpenLCB equipment may, but is not required to, omit forwarding PCER messages to a consumer of a
   particular Event ID when that consumer is in Unadvertised state.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

   After each transition to Initialized State and before sending a Producer/Consumer Event Report (PCER)
   message producing a specific Event ID outside the automatically-routed Event ID range, a node shall emit
   a Producer Identified or Producer Range Identified message identifying that Event ID.

   To ensure receipt of PCER messages, a node consuming a specific Event ID outside the
   automatically-routed Event ID shall emit a Consumer Identified or Consumer Range Identified message
   identifying that Event ID.

6.1 Event Transfer

   To produce an event, the node containing the producer emits a PCER message containing the related Event
   ID. The OpenLCB message network transports that message to all attached nodes, except as described in
   the next paragraph. Nodes containing consumers shall check for a match between the message Event ID and
   their consumers. If a match is found, the consumer shall perform any local operations configured into
   it. If a match is not found, the consumer shall not perform any local operations.

   Equipment that transports PCER messages shall transport them to all connected nodes from which the
   equipment has received a Consumer Identified or Consumer Range Identified for the reported Event ID.
   Equipment that transports PCER messages shall transport all PCER messages containing Event IDs in the
   automatically-routed range to all connected nodes. Equipment that transports PCER messages may, but is
   not required to, omit transporting PCER messages with Event ID outside the automatically-routed range to
   nodes from which the equipment has not received a Consumer Identified or Consumer Range Identified for
   the reported Event ID.

6.2 Event Enquiry

   Upon receipt of either an unaddressed (global) Identify Events message or an addressed Identify Events
   message addressed to the node, that node shall reply with Producer Identified and/or Producer Range
   Identified messages covering all non-automatically-routed Event IDs produced by the node, and Consumer
   Identified and/or Consumer Range Identified messages covering all non-automatically-routed Event IDs
   consumed by the node.

   In response to an unaddressed (global) Identify Events message or an addressed Identify Events message
   address to the node, that node may but is not required to include Producer Identified and/or Producer
   Range Identified messages covering automatically-routed Event IDs produced by the node, and Consumer
   Identified and/or Consumer Range Identified messages covering automatically-routed Event IDs consumed by
   the node.

6.3 Producer Enquiry

   Upon receipt of an Identify Producer message, a node shall reply with Producer Identified and/or
   Producer Range Identified messages covering all non-automatically-routed Event IDs produced by the node.

   In response to an Identify Producer message, a node may but is not required to include Producer
   Identified and/or Producer Range Identified messages covering automatically-routed Event IDs produced by
   the node.

6.4 Consumer Enquiry

   Upon receipt of an Identify Consumer message, a node shall reply with Consumer Identified and/or
   Consumer Range Identified messages covering all non-automatically-routed Event IDs consumed by the node.

   In response to an Identify Consumer message, a node may but is not required to include Consumer
   Identified and/or Consumer Range Identified messages covering automatically-routed Event IDs consumed by
   the node.

                                        7 Adaptation to CAN Transport

   This section describes the CAN implementation of the datagram transport message formats.

   Due to the limitations of CAN, namely a 29-bit header and 8-byte data-part, the format of CAN Event
    messages have been adapted, as per the following table.

   Message
