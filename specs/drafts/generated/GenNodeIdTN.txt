                                                1 Introduction

   This explanatory note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding “OpenLCB Node
   ID Specification”. This explanation is not normative in any way.

                                      2 Annotations to the Specification

   This section provides background information on corresponding sections of the Specification document.
   It's expected that two documents will be read together.

2.1 Introduction

2.2 References and Context

2.3 Format

   The specification doesn't require any particular human-readable format, but hex-pairs with separators
   are strongly suggested, e.g. 01.AB.34.01.CD.E3; decimal pairs could also be used, but in that case it's
   important to provide a way to know which is use.

    

   Below this is just a collection of pieces from other docs right now.
