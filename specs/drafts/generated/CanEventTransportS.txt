   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB-CAN Specifications:

   The OpenLCB Message Network Specification, which specifies …

   The OpenLCB Node Identifier Specification, which specifies …

   The OpenLCB Event Identifier Specification, which specifies ...

   “CAN” refers to the electrical and protocol specifications as defined in ISO 11898-1:2003 and ISO
   11898-2:2003 and their successors.

     * External certification of parts shall be accepted for conformance to these standards. Conformance
       with a later version of a standard shall be accepted as conformance with the referenced versions.

   After the IC message is sent, and before any corresponding Producer/Consumer Event Report messages are
   sent, the node must identify all events produced or consumed on the board via zero or more Identify
   Consumers, Identify Consumed Range, Identify Producers and Identify Consumed Range messages. These are
   not required to be in any particular order.
