   After the IC message is sent, and before any corresponding Producer/Consumer Event Report messages are
   sent, the node must identify all events produced or consumed on the board via zero or more Identify
   Consumers, Identify Consumed Range, Identify Producers and Identify Consumed Range messages. These are
   not required to be in any particular order.
