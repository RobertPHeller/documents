   This explanatory note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding “OpenLCB CAN
   Event Transport Specification”. This explanation is not normative in any way.

                                      2 Annotations to the Specification

   This section provides background information on corresponding sections of the Specification document.
   It's expected that two documents will be read together.

   Below this is just a collection of pieces from other docs right now.

    

    

   For monitoring purposes, it was proposed that a PCER message carry a sequence number which increments
   each time the associated P/C Event ID is sent. It is not at all clear how to do this across nodes, or
   even across Producers within a single node, as there may be more than one thing that can cause the same
   P/C Event ID to be sent by a single board;. We decided this would cause more problems than it solved,
   and omitted it.

   There's not room in a CAN frame for both a destination NID and a EID. The protocol has therefore been
   constructed so that any message carrying an EID (and that isn't a datagram) is globally addressed.
