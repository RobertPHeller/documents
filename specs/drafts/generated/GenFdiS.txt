                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This document defines a standard for the storage of static information that described the function
   configuration options available on an OpenLCB node, called “Function Description Information (FDI)”
   found in the configuration memory at address 0xFA.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Intended to be used to by configurable, self-contained OpenLCB  nodes.

                                             4 Format (normative)

4.1 Use of XML

4.2 FDI is constant

4.3 Other stuff

   The FDI information shall be constant.  A node may not change it after any part of it has been retrieved
   and before the next transition of the node away from the Initialized state.  (The transition back to
   Initialized state tells other nodes to flush their caches and pick up any changed content)

                               5 Stuff to be merged into the above (or the TN)

    

   The first byte is used to distinguish the coding.

   “<” (which is part of the XML “<?xml version='1.0'?>” definition): Uncoded characters

   UTF BOM: Various UniCode forms

   0x01 – tag for compressed.  One format defined for total start string of 0x0101. (If you want to use
   another format, decompress on board)

   (can't use 0x00 as lead, since that's the end-of-string indication)
