                                                1 Introduction

   There is a need for something for tiny nodes, that uses a single message instead of datagrams and
   configuration. This allows getting getting the information with a bare minimum of support at the
   requested node end, so long as the requesting node can be sure to handle it.

    

   See the larger description in the ACDI TN, which should be copied here too.  But note that SNII they can
   exist independently, which needs to be handled too.

   The Simple Node Information Reply message(s) carry a stream of bytes:

     * The byte 1 to indicate a version

     * A null-terminated string for manufacturer name

     * A null-terminated string for node model name

     * A null-terminated string for node hardware version

     * A null-terminated string for node software version

     * The byte 1 to indicate a version

     * A null-terminated string for user-provided node name

     * A null-terminated string for user-provided node description

2.5 Interactions

   When a node gets a Simple Node Information Request, if possible it shall reply with one or more Simple
   Node Information Reply messages containing the node's information.  If it's not able to process the
   information, it shall send an Optional Interaction Rejected with an appropriate error code.

   It's recommended that the rejection message have the temporary-error bit set, so that the node sending
   the original request will retry it.

                                                3 Draft notes

   Handling a second request while sending the first.  Directed, so CAN priority doesn't really help.  Just
   reject (which kind) and have upstream resend the request, if you can't hold onto the request until it
   happens again.
