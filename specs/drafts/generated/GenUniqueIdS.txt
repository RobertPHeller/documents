                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This specification describes the format and allocation of OpenLCB 48-bit unique identifiers. It is not
   specific to any wire protocol.

   For more information on format and presentation, see:

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Many OpenLCB protocols rely on each node having a node ID, and those node IDs being absolutely unique
   between nodes. OpenLCB defines 48-bit unique identifiers for this purpose. Unique identifiers are also
   used to ensure that Event Identifiers are uniquely specified, and for other purposes. This Standard is
   intended to ensure these unique IDs are available. It applies to all OpenLCB uses of 48-bit unique
   identifiers, including as node identifiers.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   (Intentionally left blank)

                                       4 Content and Format (Normative)

   An OpenLCB unique identifier (unique ID) shall be six bytes of eight bits each.

   The order of bytes in an OpenLCB unique ID shall be considered significant. The most-significant byte
   shall be transmitted first during communication operations. The most-significant byte shall be written
   first (left-most in Western format) in any human-readable representation.

   An OpenLCB unique ID shall include one or more 1 bits.

   Every OpenLCB node shall have a unique identifier to use as a node identifier (node ID).

                                           5 Allocation (Normative)

   Unique identifiers shall be allocated using one of the mechanisms in this section.

   When additional allocation methods are defined, those the unique IDs defined by those additional methods
   shall only provide allocation ranges that do no overlap with existing allocation ranges.

   Allocated ranges shall not be reused for other allocations.

    

    

    

5.1 Unique identifiers assigned by manufacturers

   Manufacturers who have been assigned a manufacturer ID number by the NMRA may, but are not required to,
   use their NMRA manufacturer ID number to self-assign unique identifiers within a range defined by:

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3      Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6 
   0x02   0x01   Mfg ID byte Self-assigned

   Manufacturers shall ensure uniqueness for identifiers they assign.

5.2 Unique identifiers assigned by members of organized groups

   An NMRA member may, but is not required to, use their NMRA membership number to self-assign unique
   identifiers within the range defined by:

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6        
   0x03   0x00   NMRA Member Number   Self-assigned 

    

   A MERG member may, but is not required to, use their MERG membership number to self-assign unique
   identifiers within the range defined by:

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6        
   0x03   0x04   MERG Member Number   Self-assigned 

    

   Individuals using these assignment patterns shall ensure uniqueness for identifiers they assign.

   MERG CBUS has a defined method for specifying a unique 16-bit Node Number (NN) for CBUS use, along with
   an optional 16-bit Layout Number (LN). People may, but are not required to, use a unique CBUS node
   number to generate an OpenLCB unique identifier as follows:

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3       Byte 4      Byte 5       Byte 6      
   0x03   0x08   LN High Byte LN Low Byte NN High Byte NN Low Byte 

    

   Future definition of ranges for additional groups will use unique values in Byte 2.

5.3 Unique identifiers assigned by software at run-time

   A program running in a computer with an IP address must not use that address to directly formulate a
   unique identifier. The program may use an IP connection to request a unique identifier from openlcb.org,
   or from another organization that is distributing unique identifiers from a range distributed to it. The
   openlcb.org mechanism will allocate individual unique identifiers from the following range:

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4    Byte 5    Byte 6   
   0x04   0x00   0x00   Sequentially Assigned Values

    

5.4 Globally defined unique identifiers

   OpenLCB defines specific well-known identification numbers and number ranges for specific uses. The
   details of these ranges are defined in other Standards and/or have been reserved for future use.

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6 Use                      
   0x01   1      0x00   0x00   0x00   0x00   Well-known Event IDs     
   0x01   1      0x01   0x00   Any           CBUS mapped Event IDs    
   0x01   99     Any                         XpressNet translation    
   0x01   129    Any                         LocoNet packet transport 
   0x01   238    Any                         DCC translation          

    

5.5 Unique identifiers assigned for use with locomotive control systems

   OpenLCB defines specific well-known identification numbers and number ranges for interoperation with
   existing locomotive control systems. The details of these ranges are defined in other Standards and/or
   have been reserved for future use.

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6 Use              
   0x06   0x00   Any                         DC (block)       
   0x06   0x01   Any                         DCC              
   0x06   0x02   Any                         TMCC             
   0x06   0x03   Any                         Marklin/Motorola 
   0x06   0x04   Any                         MTH DCS          

    

5.6 Unique identifier ranges assigned by request

   Any individual or corporation shall be able to obtain permanent allocations of blocks of 28, 216 and 224
   node identification numbers via the http://www.openlcb.org web site.

    

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6        
   0x05   0x01   Assigned by web site Self-assigned 

    

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3     Byte 4    Byte 5 Byte 6 
   0x05   0x02   Assigned by web site Self-assigned

    

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3               Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6 
   0x05   0x03   Assigned by web site Self-assigned

5.7 Reserved unique identifiers

   All other unique identifiers not specifically discussed in this Standard shall not be used until the
   Standard is revised to permit their use.

   Unique identifiers in the following ranges shall not be used at any point:

   Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3 Byte 4 Byte 5 Byte 6 
   0x00   Any    
   0xFF   Any
