                                          5 Interactions (Normative)

   OpenLCB defines a number of specific protocols for interacting with nodes, including event exchange,
   datagrams, streams, configuration, etc. These protocols are optional, in the sense that not every node
   will implement every one.

   To determine which protocols a node implements, a Protocol Support Inquiry message is sent to the
   specific node. It will reply with a Protocol Support Reply message that contains one or more bytes of
   data. A specific bit position has been reserved for each defined protocol in a separate spreadsheet
   (.ods, .pdf form). If the bit is zero or not present, the protocol is not supported and requests to use
   it will result in a error. If present and 1, the protocol is supported.

   It is not necessary to check whether a protocol is supported by a node before attempting to use the
   protocol. If it's not, the error handling mechanism (see below) will indicate that.
