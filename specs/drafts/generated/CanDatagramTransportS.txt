                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This specification describes the protocol for transporting OpenLCB datagrams via CAN segments.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   The datagram transport protocol is intended to efficiently transfer small amounts (0-72 bytes) of data
   reliably between two OpenLCB nodes.  It allows for management of overlapping independent transmissions.

   The datagram transport protocol relies on the underlying OpenLCB message transport protocol for reliable
   sequenced communications.

   This document describes the required message formats for datagram transport. §4 gives an overview of the
   message types with an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide to the construction of
   concrete message types over specific physical transport media. §§7–ff. describe in concrete detail the
   implementation of the datagram transport message formats for the specific physical transport media that
   have been adopted as normative standards.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB-CAN Specifications:

   The OpenLCB Frame Transport Standard, which specifies the use and format of CAN frames for OpenLCB
   communications.

   The OpenLCB Message Network Standard, which specifies the OpenLCB message transport mechanism.

                                        4 Message Formats (Normative)

   In the following, the “Common MTI” column specifies the the MTI value to be used when communicating in
   OpenLCB common format. The Common MTI is an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide
   to the construction of concrete message formats over specific physical transport media.

4.3 Datagram Rejected

                                                  Common              
   Name              Dest ID Event ID Simple Node        Data Content

   Datagram Rejected Y       N        N           0x0A48 Error Code   

    

   Nodes must accept and process Datagram Rejected messages that do not contain a full data code. Missing
   error code bits are to be interpreted as zero.

  4.3.1 Error Codes

   The Error Code field contains 16 bits.  The following bits are independent flags:

     * 0x1000 Permanent error – The received datagram will always invoke the same error

     * 0x2000 Resend OK – The error condition may be cleared, so a resend of the original datagram can be
       attempted

     * 0x4000 Transport error – The error could have been due to a failure in message/frame transport

   Specific values for the 16-bit field:

     * 0x1020 – Permanent error, source not permitted – this node will not accept datagrams of this type
       from the transmitting node

     * 0x1040 – Permanent error, datagrams not accepted – this node will not accept datagrams of this type
       from any node

     * 0x2000 – Temporary condition, please resend – some temporary condition in the receiving node
       prevented receiving the datagram, but there's reason to believe a resend will succeed.

     * 0x6000 – Transport error, please resend – some temporary condition, possibly in the transport layer,
       prevented receiving the datagram, but there's reason to believe a resend will succeed.

   Nodes may, but are not required to, use the low five bits of the error code field to define specific
   error codes in concert with independent flag bits defined above.

   All other bits and bit combinations are reserved.

                                             5 States (Normative)

   The common OpenLCB datagram protocol has no formal states.

   A node implementing the OpenLCB-CAN protocol must maintain a Datagram-started state for each datagram
   that it is receiving as a sequence of frames. If the node receives multiple overlapping datagrams, the
   states must be independent.

                                          6 Interactions (Normative)

6.1 Normal Transmission

   Normal transmission consists of the transmitting node sending a Datagram Content message to the
   receiving node, followed by the receiving node sending a Datagram Received OK message to the
   transmitting node. The receiving node shall send either a Datagram Received OK or Datagram Rejected
   message in reply.

  6.1.1

6.2 Rejected Transmission

   After the transmitting node sends a Datagram Content message to the receiving node, the receiving node
   may send a Datagram Rejected message to the transmitting node. The receiving node shall send either a
   Datagram Received OK or Datagram Rejected message in reply.

   If a receiving node receives a 2nd Datagram Content message before sending a reply to the the 1st
   Datagram Content message, it may, but is not required to, reject the 2nd Datagram by sending a Datagram
   Rejected message with the Out-of-Sequence error flag bit set.

   Upon receipt of a Datagram Rejected message with the Resend_OK bit sent, the original transmitting node
   may resend the same Datagram Content message, or may abandon the transmission attempt.

   Upon receipt of a Datagram Rejected message with the Resend_OK bit resent, the original transmitting
   node shall abandon the transmission attempt and not resend the original Datagram Content message.

  6.2.1

                                        7 Adaptation to CAN Transport

   Due to the limitations of CAN, namely a 29-bit header and 8-byte data-part, the format of CAN Event
    messages have been adapted, as per the following table.  

   Name                 Dest ID Event ID Simple Node Header Format          Data-part Content 
                                                     0x1Add,dsss1 — Single2                   
                                                                            
                                                     0x1Bdd,dsss — First

                                                     0x1Cdd,dsss — Middle   
                                                                            
                                                     0x1Ddd,dsss — Last     
   Datagram Received OK Y       N        N           0x19A2,8sss fddd3                        
   Datagram Rejected    Y       N        N           0x19A4,8sss fddd       Error Code        

    

               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
     

    

7.1 Interactions

  7.1.1 Normal Transmission

   Normal transmission of a datagram over CAN consists of the transmitting node sending the Datagram
   Content message using one of two sequences of Datagram frames:

     * One Datagram Content Single Frame

     * One Datagram Content First Frame, followed by zero or more Datagram Content Middle Frame, followed
       by one Datagram Content Last Frame

   A receiving node receiving either of the above sequences shall send either a Datagram Received OK or
   Datagram Rejected message in reply.

7.2 Rejected Transmission

   If a receiving node receives a sequence of Datagram frames other than one of

     * One Datagram Content Single Frame

     * One Datagram Content First Frame, followed by zero or more Datagram Content Middle Frame, followed
       by one Datagram Content Last Frame

   the receiving node shall send a Datagram Rejected message with the Out-of-Sequence error bit set.

   1 sss —The 12-bit source alias field

   2 Quality — Because CAN frames are limited to 8 bytes, datagrams larger than 8 bytes must be broken up
   among multiple messages. Thus, four distinct message types are defined to aid in flow control.

   3 0ddd — First two bytes of the data-part, representing the 12-bit destination Alias, the top 4 bits are
   zero.
