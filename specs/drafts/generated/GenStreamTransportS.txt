                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This specification defines the protocol for transmitting unidirectional streams of data between two
   nodes on an OpenLCB bus.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Streaming can be used to move large amounts of data (kilobytes and up) across a OpenLCB implementation.
    Streaming transport can also be used when the data transfer is unknown or indefinite in its volume or
   persistence.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

   This specification is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The OpenLCB Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact.
       Higher-level protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere. The Message
       Network Standard defines the encoding of stream data message on CAN physical layer, which is
       referenced here.

     * The OpenLCB Memory Access Configuration Protocol Standard, which will be used as an example of an
       application-level protocol that interacts with the Streaming protocol for data transport.

                                          4 Definitions (Normative)

   Stream is a uni-directional sequence of bytes transmitted from one OpenLCB node to another OpenLCB node.
   There is no out-of-band information that can be sent along with the payload using the Streaming
   protocol. There is no restriction on the total number of bytes sent, or the time that the stream can be
   open for sending data.

   Source node is the OpenLCB node which is sending the data (originating the stream).

   Destination node is the OpenLCB node which is receiving the data.

   Source Stream ID (SID) is a non-zero one-byte (8-bit) identifier (range [1..255]), assigned by the
   source node at its discretion to identify the stream.

   Destination Stream ID (DID) is a non-zero one-byte (8-bit) identifier (range [1..255]), assigned by the
   destination node at its discretion to identify the stream.

   Stream Content UID is a non-zero 6-byte globally unique identifier assigned to specify the type (format
   and purpose) of the data being transmitted. Stream Content UIDs are assigned in a similar fashion as
   Node IDs, but from a different numeric space.

   (Max) Buffer size is an unsigned 2-byte value (range [1..65535]) specifying the maximum number of bytes
   in-flight; that is, the maximum number of bytes the source node may send without receiving a reception
   acknowledgement from the destination node.

                                              5  Message Formats

   In the following, the “common MTI” column specifies the MTI value to be used when communicating in
   OpenLCB common format.  The Common MTI is an abstract numeric description intended as a normative guide
   to the construction of concrete message formats over specific physical transport media.

5.1 Stream Initiate Request

   Stream Initiate Request is an addressed message sent by the Source node to the Destination node to
   request creating the stream. This is the only method to create a stream.

   Data content:

5.6 States

   A stream can be in one of the following states:

   Non-existent or closed. Between the nodes <Source Node ID> → <Destination Node ID> both the Source
   Stream ID and the Destination Stream ID has never been used or the Stream according to the last use was
   completed or terminated.

   Announced. The Source node has sent the Source Stream ID to the Destination node via some higher-level
   protocol, such as in a Memory Configuration Protocol datagram 'Read Stream Reply', or 'Write Stream
   Command'.

   Initiated. The Source node has sent a Stream Initiate Request to the Destination node with the Source
   Stream ID, and is waiting for a response.

   Open. The Destination node has sent a Stream Initiate Reply to the Source node with the Source Stream ID
   and the Destination Stream ID and the error code set to Accepted.

5.7 Interactions

  5.7.1 Opening a stream with announcement

   In this method the streaming protocol works together with a higher-level protocol. It is the
   higher-level protocol that requests the transfer, and defines the format, contents and possibly the
   length of the stream payload. As part of handling the higher-level protocol, the Source node has to know
   the Destination node ID, and allocate a Source Stream ID for that Destination node that is in the Closed
   / Non-existent state. The Source node transmits the Source Stream ID to the Destination node in an
   addressed message of the higher-level protocol. The Source node then waits for a reception
   acknowledgement of the higher-level protocol (such as a Datagram Received OK) from the Destination node.
   If this acknowledgement is positive, the Stream transitions to the Announced state, if it returns an
   error, the Stream is considered to be in the Closed state. If the Destination node can not handle the
   streaming protocol, it should return an error in the higher-level protocol.

   After the acknowledgement of the reception of the announcement message, the Source node sends a Stream
   Initiate Request to the Destination node, with the same Source Stream ID as in the announcement message.
   The Source node may pass or omit the Stream Content UID in the Stream Initiate Request, as the
   higher-level protocol specification requires. The Source node proposes a Max Buffer Size for the
   transmission. Sending this message transitions the stream to the Initiated state.

   The Destination node is then required to send a Stream Initiate Reply, or one of the general error
   messages defined in the Message Network Standard, such as Optional Interaction rejected, or Terminate
   Due To Error. When possible, a Stream Initiate Reply should be sent instead of a general error message.

   To accept the stream and transition to Open state, the Destination node must allocate a Destination
   Stream ID that's not currently in use with the same Source node, reply with a Stream Initiate Reply
   message, with the error code having the Accept bit set, the Source Stream ID set to the stream ID sent
   by the Source node, the Destination Stream ID filled in, and the Max Buffer Size set to a non-zero value
   that is at less, than or equal to what was proposed in the Stream Initiate Request. Sending this message
   transitions the stream to Open state, with the Max Buffer Size as entered in the Stream Initiate Reply
   message.

   To reject the stream, the Destination node must send a general error message, or a Stream Initiate Reply
   message with the appropriate Source Stream ID, zero Max Buffer Size and the error code set to a value
   with the Accept bit clear and one of the Temporary error or Permanent error bits set. When possible, a
   Stream Initiate Reply should be sent instead of a general error message. When sending a general error
   message, when possible, the MTI value should be set to the MTI of Stream Initiate Request. A rejected
   stream is transitioned to the Closed state. If needed, the interaction may be re-started using the
   higher-level protocol.

  5.7.2 Opening a stream without announcement

   This method may only be used if the interaction is started by the Source node.

   The interaction begins with the Source node allocating a new Source Stream ID, and sending a Stream
   Initiate Request to the Destination node. This message must carry a 6-byte Stream Content UID, which
   specifies for the destination node the content and format of the data carried, and transitions the
   stream to the Initiated state. From this state onwards the interaction continues as in described in
   Section 5.7.1.

   If the Stream Content UID is unknown to the Destination node, it should use the Permanent Error,
   Unimplemented error code in the rejection message.

  5.7.3 Data transfer

   Once a stream transitioned to Open state, the Source node may start sending payload bytes using Stream
   Data Send messages. The source node may send up to Max Buffer Size bytes using one or more Stream Data
   Send messages, without needing to wait for acknowledgement from the destination node.

   When the Destination node is ready to receive another Max Buffer Size bytes, it sends a Stream Data
   Proceed message to the Source node. This signals to the Source node that it may send another Max Buffer
   Size bytes.

  5.7.4 Special provisions for Gateways

   A Gateway needs to be prepared for buffering up to Max Buffer Size bytes for each open stream. It may
   reduce the Max Buffer Size in the Stream Initiate Request message if the buffer size available is
   smaller than proposed. A Gateway must not modify the Max Buffer Size value of a Stream Initiate Response
   message.

   A Gateway may delay forwarding Stream Data Proceed messages until its internal buffer is drained.

   that support the Streaming protocol must keep track of the Stream states

   Optionally, the destination can request that the source start a transfer. This uses some mechanism not
   discussed here, e.g. Datagram messages.

   The source sends an "Stream Initiate Request (Addressed)" to the destination. It carries a "Max Buffer
   Size" value (2 bytes), a “Type Included” boolean flag (1 bit in a byte; see below for meaning) and a
   "Source Stream ID" (1 byte) in the data section. The combination of source, destination, and Source
   Stream ID must uniquely identify this stream transmission.

   If the destination node does not wish to receive the stream, it returns a "Stream Initiate Reply
   (Addressed)" marked “reject”, with a "Max Buffer Size" value (2 bytes) of zero, the “Type Included”
   boolean flag (1 bit in a flag byte), "Source Stream ID" (1 byte) and "Destination Stream ID" (1 byte).
   The message includes flags set to represent exactly one of several conditions:

   “Permanent error” - This node does not process streams, will not accept a stream from this source, or
   for some other reason will not ever be able to accept this stream. The Stream Initiate Request should
   not be retransmitted. Optionally, the node can mark the reply with one or more of several conditions:

   “Information Logged” - the node supports the logging protocol and information was logged for later
   retrieval.

   “Invalid Stream Request” - something made the stream request improper, such as longer than the max
   permitted length. Proper requests might be acceptable.

   “Source not permitted” - streams from this source will never be accepted

   “Streams not accepted” - this node will not accept stream requests under any circumstance. A node can
   also reject the interaction instead of sending Stream Initiate Reply with this code.

   “Buffer shortage, resend” - The node isn't able to receive the stream because of a shortage of buffers.
   The sending node should resend at its convenience.

   “Stream rejected, out of order” - Should not happen, but an internal inconsistency was found in the CAN
   frames making up a stream. Sender can try again if desired.

   If the destination node wishes to receive the stream, it returns a "Stream Initiate Reply (Addressed)"
   marked “accept”, with a "Max Buffer Size" value (2 bytes), the “Type Included” boolean flag (1 bit in a
   byte), "Source Stream ID" (1 byte) and "Destination Stream ID" (1 byte).  The "Max Buffer Size" is less
   than or equal to the value in the Initiate Stream Request, and is the negotiated buffer size for this
   transfer. If it's zero, the request to start the stream has been rejected, and the exchange is over. The
   source can try again later. The Source Stream ID is the same as the value in the Initiate Stream
   Request, and is returned for identification and the convenience of the source. The destination doesn't
   do anything with it except return it. The source can use it to match up multiple operations, as a way of
   identifying buffers, or for any other purpose. The Destination Stream ID is used to tag the data sent to
   the destination. It has no meaning to the source. The destination can, but need not, use it to associate
   the stream data with a particular buffer or usage. Multiple simultaneous streams can use the same
   Destination Stream ID value.

   The source starts sending bytes using Stream Data Send (Addressed) messages, each carrying up to the
   message size limit on the particular wire protocol and the Source and Destination Stream ID. After
   sending exactly Max Buffer Size bytes in one or more messages, the source pauses.

   If the “Type Included” flag was true during initialization, the first 6 bytes of the data are a unique
   data-type indicator. These are allocated the same way that Node IDs, etc, are allocated, but from a
   separate name space. If that “Type Included” flag is false, some higher-level protocol must identify the
   data-type of the stream data. The idea is that a stream is a lot of data; there's not much use for one
   otherwise because of the setup overhead (code and time). So six bytes for a stream type identifier isn't
   a large cost (unlike e.g. a datagram, where it would be a 10% overhead). A UID as a Stream type ID has
   the advantage that it's not ever going to collide, so people developing protocols don't have to
   coordinate it (e.g. useful for future expansion, where a protocol can be locally developed and then
   deployed more widely). And it still fits in the 1st CAN Frame of the stream, which simplifies what nodes
   have to do to figure out what type of (unsolicited) data this is. On the other hand, streams have a
   stream ID, so that a protocol can use some other mechanism (messages, datagrams, or even other streams)
   to pass the information about what a specific new stream means. That means the type info at the start of
   the stream isn't as necessary as in e.g. datagrams. (We really wanted to avoid situations like "The next
   datagram you receive carries the data for this request", because "next" is a hard concept to ensure in
   code that's doing several things independently)

   On CAN, the Stream Data Send message does not carry the Destination Stream ID field. Messages to CAN get
   split into frames and forwarded without the field. Messages from CAN have to have it inserted by the
   gateway as part of the translation process. The gateway can do this as part of the (optional) buffer
   accumulation from frames into larger transfers.

   Upon receiving Max Buffer Size bytes via one or more messages, the destination sends a Stream Data
   Proceed (Addressed) message to the source, carrying the Source Stream ID and Destination Stream ID. This
   tells the source that there is enough buffer space available that another Max Buffer Size bytes can be
   sent. The destination can also set flag bits (error codes) in this message to indicate that no more data
   should be sent and the transmission should be terminated early.

   The destination may, but is not required to, send a Stream Data Proceed (Addressed) message to the
   source before receiving the full count of Max Buffer Size bytes.  In that case, the source does not stop
   transmission after sending Max Buffer Size bytes, but continues for an additional Max Buffer Size bytes
   of transmission.

   When the last data has been sent, the source sends a Stream Data Complete message carrying the Source
   Stream ID and Destination Stream ID to indicate that all data has been sent. Optionally, this can carry
   a four-byte length of the stream data transferred for checking. A zero value, if present, means the
   length is unknown. When this message is received by the destination, the transfer is complete.

                                           6 Background Information

6.1 Stream Content Type Identification

   Stream senders can, but don't have to, identify the content type (format, meaning, etc) of the data
   stream at the front. As part of their private protocol, they can use whatever structure they'd like for
   the data.

   General content types can be defined using unique identifiers. The “Type Included” flag identifies that
   the first eight bytes of stream data are to be interpreted as stream content type information. These can
   be allocated via the same mechanisms as EventIDs. Well-known ones will be published by OpenLCB. These
   identifiers are recorded in a separate worksheet.

6.2 Buffer Size

   The buffer size can be up to 216-1 bytes = 64KB-1. This is driven by the size of the initiate messages,
   which we want to keep in a single CAN frame. Although some transport mechanisms might be able to
   profitably use larger buffers, it seems unlikely that a layout control bus will need to have a higher
   message efficiency or lower latency than this size will allow. Should that turn out to be necessary in
   the future, an alternate form for the stream initialization messages can be defined for those
   large-message nodes. (It's unlikely they're running over CAN)

6.3 CAN Discussion

   On a CAN segment, the data limit is 8 bytes. This requires use of as little control information as
   possible, so that as many of those eight bytes can be used for data as possible.

   OpenLCB/S9.6 CAN frames can hold the source and destination aliases in the header. A dedicated “stream
   data transfer” format can also be coded entirely in the header. This then allows 8 bytes of data per
   transfer if the Source Stream ID and Destination Stream ID need not be carried. By specifying that only
   one stream can be transferred on a CAN link between any two nodes at a time, no Stream ID would be
   needed. Although initially consider, this it thought to be too inflexible. Instead, we chose a format
   where the Source Stream ID is carried, reducing the payload to seven bytes per frame. This requires that
   the Source Stream ID be unique among source-destination node pairs, without relying on the Destination
   Stream ID to be part of the unique stream identification. Since a node knows that it's originating the
   stream, this can be ensured in advance for point-to-point connections. Gateways will need to track the
   Destination Stream ID to restore it to the full format. Since they are tracking the stream in any case
   for buffering purposes, this is thought to be not a large problem.

6.4 Implementation Notes

   The "Stream Data Proceed" from the destination is clearance to send another buffer-size-worth of data.
   To achieve better performance, the destination can send it before receiving the entire buffer-size-worth
   of data, as soon as it has room to receive what's already been OK'd plus one more buffer size. For
   example, a destination with a 4kB buffer could reply with Max Buffer Size of 2K, followed by an
   immediate Stream Data Proceed, to do single overlap of the transfer.

   Intermediate nodes need to be able to handle transfers, and therefore need permission to lower the Max
   Buffer Size on the outbound Stream Initiate Request message. The length in the returned Stream Initiate
   Reply can't be changed, as the destination need to know when to send clearance for another buffer's
   worth of data.

   A CAN ↔ Ethernet bridge might receive several kilobytes of data from the Ethernet side at a time. It's
   then responsible for breaking that up into CAN frames and forwarding it. It can reduce the buffer size
   of transfers if need be to ensure there's a place to store the data while this is done.
