                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This Standard describes the format and allocation of OpenLCB event identifiers (event IDs). It is not
   specific to any wire protocol.

                                    2 References and Context (Informative)

   This Standard is in the context of the following OpenLCB Standards:

     * The Message Network Standard, which defines the basic messages and how they interact. Higher-level
       protocols are based on this message network, but are defined elsewhere.

     * The Event Transport Standard, which defines the protocol for transporting events.

     * The Unique Identifiers Standard witch defines the format and allocation of unique 48-bit
       identifiers.

                                                   3 Format

   An OpenLCB event identifier shall be eight bytes of eight bits each.  Except as specifically noted
   within this document, the upper 6-bytes are represented by a uniquely assigned Node ID.

   The order of bytes in an OpenLCB event ID shall be considered significant. The most-significant byte
   shall be transmitted first during communication operations. The most-significant byte shall be written
   first (left-most in Western format) in any human-readable representation.
