   This package of Standards and Technical Notes

   are submitted to the NMRA Board

   for acceptance as the

   First Official Release

   of

   Layout Command and Control – LCC

    

    

    

   This set of Standards and Technical Notes documents forms the basis and infrastructure for an extensible
   and flexible layout control bus system for Model Railroads.  It is designed for both the novice and
   experienced modeler, and both small personal and large modular group layout.  

    

   It was developed in public by the OpenLCB Development Team with the input from many people but
   especially the members of the OpenLCB egroup on Yahoogroups.  It is the accumulation of years of work,
   with goals set forth by the NMRA Board as Goals and Mandate, and the self-determined Goals and Measures,
   documents.  

    

    

    

   The OpenLCB Development Team consists of: Stuart Baker USA, Dick Bronson USA, Ken Cameron USA, Don
   Goodman-Wilson USA, David Harris Canada, Tim Hatch USA, Bob Jacobsen USA, Jim Kueneman USA, Balazs Racz
   Switzerland, and Alex Shepherd New Zealand.  

    

   Special thanks to Stephen Priest, NMRA Board Liaison, and the members of the OpenLCB egroup, especially
   Robert Middleton, for their discussion, suggestions and  for reviewing the documents.
