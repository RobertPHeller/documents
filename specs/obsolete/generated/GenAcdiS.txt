                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This Standard specifies a simplified or Abbreviated Configuration Description Information (ACDI)
   suitable for all nodes to provide a basic set of information using a protocol that is simplified over
   the one used for the CDI protocol.  

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Provides quick access to basic information on a node, so that a system can get quick summaries of all
   the nodes present without spending the time to do a full CDI read and then configuration read.

                                     3 References and Context (Normative)

     * OpenLCB Common Information Technical Note

   There are separate documents that discuss (a) Configuration Protocol and the full mechanisms for
   Configuration Description Information. In this document, we discuss an abbreviated form of configuration
   description information that is useful for rapid retrieval of basic information from an OpenLCB node.

                                   4 Memory space configuration (Normative)

   This describes version 1 of the data format. (Need to be very clear about versioning; particularly for
   permanent part)

   If PIP says memory access configuration protocol is present, and that this protocol is present, then the
   data must be available in these places.

4.1 Constant data

   Read from space 0xFC

   (See XML for layout)

4.2 User-modifiable data

   Read from space 0xFB

   (See XML for layout)

4.3 Icon data

   Space 0xFA

   As a PNG sequence (need more info on PNG options?)

                                       5 Retrieval Protocol (Normative)

   (references Memory Configuration Protocol; prefer but don't require single reads to pick up the
   information, can also just get one item)

                                               6 Open Questions

   We're providing two retrieval methods:  Via the 0x3520/0x3530 MTIs, and via configuration read from
   specific spaces. Are both needed?  Is that overly complex?  Should PIP show them separately?  

   Should length limits on the manufacturer strings be provided? Total length?  

   Make clear that it's multiple frames on CAN, and can be either multiple or a single message on other
   protocols.  How do you know where the end is if it's multiple messages or CAN frames messages?  You
   don't.  You just accept & process the data as it arrives.
