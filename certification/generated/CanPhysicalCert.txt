                                         1 Introduction (Informative)

   This is the certification procedure for the OpenLCB-CAN Physical Layer Standard.  To certify an OpenLCB
   board, check each of the items below.

                                         2 Intended Use (Informative)

   Nothing in this section of the Standard requires testing.

   Check that, were components of the following types are certified by their manufacturer:

     * RJ45

     * UTP

     * CAN, including both the transceiver and controller devices.

                                          4 Physical Interconnection

   Cables have RJ45 plugs on each end.

   CAN connections on boards are done using RJ45 jacks.

   The jack wiring is done as shown in figure 1 of the standard.

   Pairs in cables are as described in the standard.

   If the node has more than one jack, the jacks are interconnected as described in the standard.

   The design documents that the required voltages on the jack conductors will not damage the device.

                                               5 Data Transport

   The device is documented to use 125kbps.

   If the device provides CAN bus termination, ...
