   (just a place-keeper for a pile tech note explaining reasoning, not well written)

    

   We don't discuss CAN terminators, because they're discussed in detail in the CAN documentation that the
   standard references.  A simple resistor on a RJ45 plug can be used, or more complex devices can be
   created and sold that e.g. contain diagnostic readouts.  So long as it provides in-spec termination,
   they're all fine.

    

   Physical Interconnection

    

   We're trying to enable two basic kinds of nodes:   Board with 2 connectors and box with a pig-tail
   cable, e.g. a handheld throttle.  But we don't want to rule out e.g. a board with two connectors and
   three pig-tails for attaching throttles, or anything else, hence the somewhat complex wording in this
   section.

    

   The assignments to particular colors are for information only. These are the colors that users will
   encounter in the two popular ways of wiring commercial cables.  If you're building a product using
   commercial cable, using one of these two color codes will reduce confusion, but most NMRAnet users will
   never need to refer to the colors in their cables.

    

   The discussion of connecting in parallel is to make sure that all 8 wires go through a board, whether
   it's got connectors, pig-tail cables or a combination of the two, so long as it's got more than one
   connection to other nodes.

    

   All 8 wires don't have to go through the board if there's only one connection, e.g. a throttle with a
   single jack or pig-tail cable with plug. In that case, only two pairs are required.

    

   We want all 8 wires present so people can add power later, or we can define the reserved conductors
   later, and still use them. The 1A on interconnects is to make sure they're at least as robust as the
   connectors and cable.

    

   If your product is providing power and has e.g. two jacks, you can either connect them together and
   provide a max of 0.5A to both, or separately power them up to 0.5A each. This is the only case where a
   conductor doesn't have to pass through the board as a continuous electrical circuit. Note that this
   means that your product has to provide power, however; if providing power is an option, not always
   present, you should connect conductor 8 across the board to ensure that downstream nodes aren't cut off
   from power when it's not provided by your board.

    

   The 100V requirement on the reserved conductors is also there to make sure that when we later find a use
   for it, we don't blow up existing installations.

   “IPC-2152 — Standard for Determining Current-carrying Capacity in Printed Board Design, 2009.”

    

   Power Supply

    

   The power supply section is meant to define a 12V nominal system with wide margins on production and
   consumption of power over the UTP cable. We expect that nodes will use this power in a range of ways,
   including having local power regulation ranging from simple analog regulators through more advanced
   supplies that increase current and/or voltage. 12V was chosen to reduce heat loads when using the
   simplest regulators.  The current limit was required by use of 1 conductor in UTP wiring.

    

   Power can be injected into the cable by simple “mid-span injector” devices, essentially just two RJ45
   connectors and a 2mm jack for a wall-wart. It's not required that it comes from a NMRAnet node itself.

    

   We expect that most power-supplying and power-consuming boards will connect PWR_NEG and the 3/7 grounds.
    A good way to do this is a 10 ohm resistor and a 0.1uF capacitor in parallel, but a straight copper
   connection is within the letter of the requirement.

    

   The power provisions are for low-power uses that can be conveniently handled over short lengths of
   cable.  Boards are welcome to have other connectors for power. These other connectors can be anything
   not otherwise forbidden by some other standard, including terminal blocks, 2.1mm jacks, Anderson
   PowerPole connectors, or whatever else is considered useful for the specific market.

    

   Note the effect of the “must withstand” logic is that power supply boards must be able to be connected
   to each other, even if their output voltages are not exactly the same. One way to handle this is an
   isolating diode on the PWR_POS output.
