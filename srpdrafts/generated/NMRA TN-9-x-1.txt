                                                1 Introduction

   This Technical Note contains informative discussion and background for the corresponding S 9.x.1
   Standard. This Technical Note is not normative in any way.

                                                2 Intended Use

   There is no intention that devices that connect more than on CAN segment (e.g. bridges) have to
   electrically interconnect those separate segments.  

   We don't discuss CAN terminators, because they're discussed in detail in the CAN documentation that the
   standard references.  A simple resistor on a RJ45 plug can be used, or more complex devices can be
   created and sold that e.g. contain diagnostic readouts.  So long as it provides in-spec termination,
   they're all fine.

                                           3 References and Context

   NMRA conformance testing is simplified when it can be done by referring to vendor documentation, rather
   than requiring specific tests of parameters.  The standard therefore refers to other to existing
   standards, where possible, instead of repeating the information here.

                                          4 Physical Interconnection

   We're trying to enable two basic kinds of nodes:   Board with 2 connectors and box with a pig-tail
   cable, e.g. a handheld throttle.  But we don't want to rule out e.g. a board with two connectors and
   three pig-tails for attaching throttles, or anything else, hence the somewhat complex wording in this
   section.

   The assignments to particular colors are for information only. These are the colors that users will
   encounter in the two popular ways of wiring commercial cables.  If you're building a product using
   commercial cable, using one of these two color codes will reduce confusion, but most NMRAnet users will
   never need to refer to the colors in their cables.

   The signal names refer back to the signal definitions in the CAN specifications. UTP is unshielded
   cable, so the CAN_SHIELD conductor is being used as a second conductor for the CAN ground reference,
   CAN_GND.

   The discussion of connecting in parallel is to make sure that all 8 wires go through a board, whether
   it's got connectors, pig-tail cables or a combination of the two, so long as it's got more than one
   connection to other nodes.

   We want all 8 wires present so people can add power later, or we can define the reserved conductors
   later, and still use them. The 1A on interconnects is to make sure they're at least as robust as the
   connectors and cable.

   For information on sizing circuit board traces to carry the required interconnection current, please see
   “IPC-2152 — Standard for Determining Current-carrying Capacity in Printed Board Design, 2009.”

   All 8 wires don't have to go through the board if there's only one connection, e.g. a throttle with a
   single jack or pig-tail cable with plug. In that case, only two pairs are required.

   If your product is providing power and has e.g. two jacks, you can either connect them together and
   provide a max of 0.5A to both combined, or separately power them up to 0.5A each. This is the only case
   where a conductor doesn't have to pass through the board as a continuous electrical circuit. Note that
   this means that your product has to provide power, however; if providing power is an option, not always
   present, you should connect conductor 8 across the board to ensure that downstream nodes aren't cut off
   from power when it's not provided by your board.

   The 100V requirement on the reserved conductors is also there to make sure that when we later find a use
   for it, we don't blow up existing installations. The goal is to have all existing installations be able
   to move to newly-defined uses without having to retrofit cables nor non-involved nodes.

   If you want to use the reserved conductors for experimental purposes, we recommend using jumpers (fixed
   or movable) for making connections to the conductors and/or splitting the reserved conductors between
   connectors so that you can restore normal usage later, should some other use be defined for them.  

   The 27V requirement comes from the S9.1 limitation on track voltage.

                                               5 Data Transport

   A 4V/microsecond slew rate is preferred to reduce the effect of stubs on the network.

   This standard is silent on the use of specific CAN frame formats or features.

                                              6 Supply of Power

   The power supply section is meant to define a 12V nominal system with wide margins on production and
   consumption of power over the UTP cable. We expect that nodes will use this power in a range of ways,
   including having local power regulation ranging from simple analog regulators through more advanced
   supplies that increase current and/or voltage. 12V was chosen to reduce heat loads when using the
   simplest regulators.  The current limit was required by use of 1 conductor in UTP wiring.

   Power can be injected into the cable by simple “mid-span injector” devices, essentially just two RJ45
   connectors and a 2.1mm jack for a wall-wart. It's not required that it comes from a NMRAnet node itself.

   Note that the standard permits, but does not require, connecting the CAN signal ground on conductors 3 &
   6 with the PWR_NEG power distribution ground on conductor 7. We expect that most power-supplying and
   power-consuming boards will connect PWR_NEG and the 3/6 grounds to simplify their internal structure.
   Designers should carefully consider noise immunity, the possibility of ground loop, and voltage offsets
   when doing this. A straight copper connection is within the letter of the requirement. An alternative to
   connecting them directly is e.g. a 10 ohm resistor and a 0.1uF capacitor in parallel.

   The power provisions are for low-power uses that can be conveniently handled over short lengths of
   cable.  Boards are welcome to have other connectors for power. These other connectors can be anything
   not otherwise forbidden by some other standard, including terminal blocks, 2.1mm jacks, Anderson
   PowerPole connectors, or whatever else is considered useful for the specific market.

   Note the effect of the “must withstand” requirement is that power supply boards must be able to be
   connected to each other, even if their output voltages are not exactly the same. One way to handle this
   is an isolating diode on the PWR_POS output.

                                            7 Consumption of Power

   For their thermal calculations, node designers must assume that power is supplied at 15V.

   For their power calculations, node designers must assume that power is supplied at 7.5V.

                                                8 Termination

     The CAN specification (ISO11898-2 section 7.1 and section 7.5.2) specifies using a bus termination of
   120±10 ohms located at each end of the bus..  Several alternate termination schemes have been proposed
   in the literature (see references), and these alternatives are discussed below.    

8.1 Methods

  8.1.1 Passive single resistor:  

   This consists simply of a 120 ohm connected etween CAN-H and CAN-L  , and is the commonest termination
   scheme.  It main advantage is simplicity.  

  8.1.2 Passive split resistors to ground: 

   This consists of the CAN-L and CAN-H lines being connected by two 60 ohm resistors in series, with their
   common connected via a capacitor to ground.   This is simple but also  helps balance the two lines.  

  8.1.3 Passive split resistors to fixed voltage: 

   As in (2), but common is also tied to a fixed voltage. This can be to nominal 2.5V via a voltage divider
   (ref xx), or by other means, by using a voltage   reference  

  8.1.4 Active termination: 

   This termination is accomplished by using active elements, such as transistors or op-amps to  actively
   drive the bus to its active state.   Note: active termination requires power.  

  8.1.5 Distributed termination: 

   ??  

8.2 Placement:   

Any termination can be supplied as a on-board option, or as a terminator- connector.  Obviously, this is based
on the preferences of the manufacturer and  users. Using terminator-plugs would seem to provide the maximum
flexibility.  However, as long as on-board termination is de-selectable, flexibility is  maintained.
Manufacturers may want to provide a special termination node that  as well as providing passive or active
termination, also provides some  indication of bus health.  

Termination should, generally, only occur at the two distant ends of the bus, termination in the middle of a
significant-length CAN bus is very disruptive because it causes reflections.  The one downside to on-board
termination is that it makes it much easier to have multiple terminators (customers think more must be good,
and mistakenly turn them all on).

   This section provides references, and when possible URLs, that may be of use to NMRAnet implementors.

9.1 Standards

   The S 9.x.1 standard references ISO 11898-1 and ISO 11898-2 for CAN specifications.  The ISO
   (http://www.iso.org) sells PDF and paper copies of these. Copies can generally be found in engineering
   libraries.

   Note that ISO 11898-3, 11898-4 and 11898-5 specify different variants of the CAN standard that are not
   relevant to S 9.x.1 compliant implementations.  The original 1995 Bosch CAN standard, which can be found
   online, is similar to IS 11898-1 and -2, but not identical.

   The S 9.x.1 standard references TIA/EIA-568-B or the successor TIA/EIA- 568-C for unshielded twisted
   pair (UTP) cable, and TIA-968-A for RJ45 modular plugs and jacks.  The TIA (http://www.tiaonline.org)
   sells PDF and paper copies of these. Copies can generally be found in engineering libraries.
