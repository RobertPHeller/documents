   Layout Command and Control – LCC

   Documentation Package

   February 2015

    

    

    

    

   This package of Standards and Technical Notes

   are submitted to the NMRA Board

   for consideration as the

   First Official Release

   of

   Layout Command and Control – LCC

    

    

    

   This set of Standards and Technical Notes documents forms the basis and infrastructure for an extensible
   and flexible layout control bus system for Model Railroads.  It is designed for both the novice and
   experienced modeler, and both small personal and large modular group layout.  

    

   It was developed in public by the OpenLCB Development Team with the input from many people but
   especially the members of the OpenLCB egroup on Yahoogroups.  It is the accumulation of years of work,
   following the NMRA Board mandated Goals and Mandate, and the self-determined Goals and Measures
   documents.  

    

    

    

   The OpenLCB Development Team includes: Stuart Baker USA, Dick Bronson USA, Ken Cameron USA, Don
   Goodman-Wilson USA, David Harris Canada, Tim Hatch USA, Bob Jacobsen USA, Jim Kueneman USA, Balazs Racz
   Switzerland, Alex Shepherd New Zealand, and others who have contributed their knowledge and inspiration.
    

    

   Special thanks to Stephen Priest, NMRA Board Liaison, and the members of the OpenLCB egroup, especially
   Robert Middleton, for their discussion, suggestions and review of the documents.
